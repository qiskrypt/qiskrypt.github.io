# **About**

***

The [**Qiskrypt**](https://qiskrypt.github.io/) is a suite of protocols of _quantum cryptography_ built, using the [**IBM**](https://www.ibm.com/)'s _open-source_ _Software Development Kit_ for _quantum computing_ [**Qiskit**](https://qiskit.org/).

## Foundation

This _framework_ started as a proposal for the [**IBM**](https://www.ibm.com/) [**Hackathon Europe 2021**](https://qiskithackathoneurope.bemyapp.com/), achieving the last phase of the _Hackathon_ (top 20 teams).

The aim of our _framework_ is to provide all the known _quantum cryptographic protocols_, in a single place, as an accessible solution, and being easy to use.

## Mission

The _mission_ of our _project_ is to:
* Emphatize the importance of _Quantum Cryptography_, as a long-term solution for the _Post-Quantum Era_.
* Provide _open-source_ implementations of _quantum cryptographic protocols_, including the latest trends on this topic.
