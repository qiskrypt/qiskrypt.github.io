# **About**

***

The [**Qiskrypt**](https://qiskrypt.github.io/) is a _suite_ of _protocols_ of _quantum cryptography_ built, using the [**_IBM_**](https://www.ibm.com/)'s _open-source_ _Software Development Kit_ for _quantum computing_ [**_Qiskit_**](https://qiskit.org/).

## **_Foundation_**

This _framework_ started as a proposal for the [**_IBM_**](https://www.ibm.com/) [**_Hackathon Europe 2021_**](https://qiskithackathoneurope.bemyapp.com/), achieving the last phase of the **_Hackathon_** (_top 20 teams_).

The aim of our _framework_ is to provide all the known _quantum cryptography protocols_, in a _single_ place,

## **_Mission_**

The _mission_ of our _project_ is to:
* Emphatize the importance of _Quantum Cyptography_, as a _long-term_ solution for the _Post-Quantum Era_.
* Provide _open-source_ implementations of _quantum cryptographic protocols_, including the latest trends on this topic.
